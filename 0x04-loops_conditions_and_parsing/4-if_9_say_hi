# This script displays "Best School" 10 times, printing "Hi" on the 9th iteration

# 1. Initialize the counter, starting at 1 for easy iteration tracking
COUNT=1

# 2. Start the while loop (runs as long as COUNT is less than or equal to 10)
while [ $COUNT -le 10 ]
do
    # 3. Print the base phrase
    echo "Best School"

    # 4. Check if the current iteration is the 9th one
    if [ $COUNT -eq 9 ]; then
        # If it is the 9th iteration, print "Hi" on a new line
        echo "Hi"

    # 5. Increment the counter (crucial for loop termination)
    COUNT=$((COUNT + 1))
