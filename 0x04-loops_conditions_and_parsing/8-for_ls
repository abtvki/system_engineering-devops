    # 2. Check if the current item is an actual file/directory and not just a pattern that failed to expand
    # The -f check is a common way to ensure you're dealing with a file, 
    # but the simplest approach to handle the requirement is to check for the dash.
    
    # 3. Use parameter expansion to remove the part of the string up to and including the first dash (-)
    # ${FILE#*-} means: Remove the shortest match of the pattern '*-' 
    # (everything from the start of the string up to and including the first dash) from the front of $FILE.
    
    # Check if the filename contains a dash before processing
    if [[ "$FILE" == *_* ]]; then
