# This script is displaying "Best School" 10 times using a while loop

# 1. Initialize a counter variable
COUNT=0

# 2. Start the while loop
# The loop continues as long as the value of COUNT is less than 10
while [ $COUNT -lt 10 ]
do
    # 3. Print the desired phrase
    echo "Best School"

    # 4. Increment the counter (crucial step to prevent an infinite loop)
    COUNT=$((COUNT + 1))
