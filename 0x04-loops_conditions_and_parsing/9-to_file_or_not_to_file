# This script checks for the existence, emptiness, and type of a file named 'school'.

# Define the file name
FILE="school"

# 1. Check for existence: Use the -e operator
if [ -e "$FILE" ]; then
    # File exists branch
    echo "$FILE file exists"

    # 2. Check for emptiness (only if the file exists)
    # The -s operator checks if the file has a size greater than zero (i.e., is NOT empty)
    if [ -s "$FILE" ]; then
        echo "$FILE file is not empty"
    else
        # The file exists but -s is false, meaning it is empty
        echo "$FILE file is empty"
    fi

    # 3. Check for regular file type (only if the file exists)
    # The -f operator checks if the file is a regular file
    if [ -f "$FILE" ]; then
        echo "$FILE is a regular file"
    # If it is not a regular file (e.g., a directory, link, etc.), 
    # we follow the requirement to print nothing for this check.

    # File does not exist branch
    echo "$FILE file does not exist"
