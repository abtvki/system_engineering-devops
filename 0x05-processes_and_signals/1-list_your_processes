# This script displays a list of all currently running processes in a user-oriented, hierarchical tree format.

# Use the 'ps' command with the following flags:
# - 'a': Show processes for all users (not just processes associated with a terminal).
# - 'u': Display in a user-oriented format (includes USER, %CPU, %MEM, etc.).
# - 'x': Show processes without an attached terminal (TTY).
# - 'f': Display the output in a "forest" format, which visualizes the process hierarchy (parent/child relationships).
